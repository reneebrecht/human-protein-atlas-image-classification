0.  Nucleoplasm			whole nucleus without nucleoli, can vary from smooth to punctuate
1.  Nuclear membrane		thin circle around nucleus, can have folds circles also inside nucleus
2.  Nucleoli			slightly elongated circular areas in nucleoplasm
3.  Nucleoli fibrillar center	dense fibrils, spotty clusters inside nucleolus 
4.  Nuclear speckles		irregular mottled spots in nucleoplasm  
5.  Nuclear bodies   		distinct membrane-less spots, vary in size and numbers
6.  Endoplasmic reticulum   	network-like in cytosol, close to nucleus
7.  Golgi apparatus   		next to nucleus close to centrosome, vary in morphology
8.  Peroxisomes   		vesicles spread throughout the cell, vary in number size and shape
9.  Endosomes   			vesicles close to nucleus and Golgi 
10.  Lysosomes   		vesicles close to Golgi, larger than endosomes
11.  Intermediate filaments   	network dense in perinuclear region, slightly tangled, not microtubule
12.  Actin filaments   		conc. in prox.to plasma membrane, cell cortex, long straight bundles
13.  Focal adhesion sites   	dense elongated plaques in plasma membrane
14.  Microtubules   		thin strands throughout the whole cell, originate from centrosome
15.  Microtubule ends  		sprinkled pattern, outermost tip of microtubule 
16.  Cytokinetic bridge   	intracellular bridge cytokinesis, tightly bundled microtubules, gap
17.  Mitotic spindle   		microtubules radiating from the centrosomes, condensed DAPI
18.  Microt. org. cent. MTOC  	centre of microtubules, stars
19.  Centrosome   		interphase one or two spots close to nucleus
20.  Lipid droplets   		vary in size and number, larger ones ring-like appearance hydrophobic core
21.  Plasma membrane   		edge around cell, ruffles, uniform across entire cell
22.  Cell junctions   		at contact sites, small patches or long stretches
23.  Mitochondria   		thread-like pattern along microtubules
24.  Aggresome   		dense cytoplasmatic inclusion
25.  Cytosol   			smooth to granular, often stronger close to nucleus
26.  Cytoplasmic bodies   	granular assemblies, usually bigger and lower numbers than vesicles
27.  Rods & rings  		look like rods and rings, vary in size but are quite large
